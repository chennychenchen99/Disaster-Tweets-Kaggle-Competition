# Download the Model Files

Go to the Google Drive folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19UOvovhna5Tdev9awvmTa5pEkmaznufY?usp=sharing
and drag the files to this directory. 

These are the files to add:
1) glove_model.h5
2) glove_tokenizer.h5

The BERT model is saved on personal Google Drive when training the model and is used to predict the test data in the same .ipynb file.
