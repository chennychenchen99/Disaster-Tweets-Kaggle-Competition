# Disaster Tweets Kaggle Competition
Course Project for CSE145 - Intro to Data Mining

The goal of the task asked in the Kaggle Competition was to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a Tweet talks about a real disaster taking place or not. 

Submissions to the competition are evaluated using F1 between the predicted and expected answers.

The data contains around ~10,000 hand-classified Tweets.
